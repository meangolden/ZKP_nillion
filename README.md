# ZKP Protocol Repository

This repository contains the outline of a modified version of the Chaum-Pederson Zero-Knowledge Protocol. 

## Files

- `exp_auth.py`: This file runs the zero knowledge protocol. 
- `domain_parameters.py`: This file contains functions to generate domain parameters with cryptographic properties. These parameters are needed for `auth.py`. Additionally, it has been used to create a spreadsheet with a list of appropriate domain parameters. 
- `large_primes.txt`: This file contains a case of very large domain parameters (primes of size 625 base 10). 

## Usage

To use the protocol, simply run the `exp_auth.py` file.
